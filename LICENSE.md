Instead of adopting an existing license, I'm just gonna give a few rules regarding the usage of this software:

-  `code` in this context refers to both source and releases (jarfiles).
- Anything you base of this code MUST be open-source (preferably linked back to this repo).
- The licenses of this project's dependencies are unaffected and remain in effect.
- You CANNOT use anything in the `/sounds` folder without permission from **LewisTehMinerz#1337** or **Ghosty
#8204** (Contact via Discord).
- This license MUST remain with this code in its entirety.
